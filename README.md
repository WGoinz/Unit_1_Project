## Overview/Description
### Playing The Game - Starting
My first project for General Assembly was "Simon Says". 

When the game is loaded, the player is supposed to select a difficulty ,and then the player should click "START GAME". If this is not done, the game will start at the "easy" difficulty by default. 

After starting the game there will be an audio cue notifying the player to start playing, followed by the game animations spinning up. There is background music playing as well.

### Playing The Game - Rules
The computer will play a sequence and then give the player a chance to repeat the sequence back. The player enters their input by clicking the corresponding colors in the same order the computer displayed them. 
If you guess the sequence correctly, you will go to the next level and your score will be increased by 1.
If you guess the sequence incorrectly, the game ends. Your final score will equal the number of completed sequences.
You can begin a new game by selecting the difficulty once more and clicking the "START GAME" button again.
